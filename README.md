# Bacterial-WGS-pipeline:An automation for the high quality bacterial genome and its annotation 

This repository contains a comprehensive command-line pipeline for bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis, from quality control to genome annotation. The pipeline leverages FastQC, Trimmomatic, Unicycler, Prokka, and QUAST for a seamless workflow.
## Pipeline Overview

1. **Quality Control (QC):**
   - FastQC: Assesses raw read quality.
   - Trimmomatic: Removes low-quality bases and adapter sequences.

2. **Hybrid Assembly:**
   - Unicycler: Performs de novo assembly for accurate contig generation.

3. **Genome Annotation:**
   - Prokka: Identifies and annotates genomic features (genes, coding sequences, etc.).

4. **Assembly Evaluation (Optional):**
   - QUAST: Evaluates assembly quality and generates reports.

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository URL]
   cd [repository name]
   
## Data Preparation:

Place your raw FASTQ files (e.g., SRR1234567_1.fastq.gz, SRR1234567_2.fastq.gz) in the sra/ directory.
(Optional) If using QUAST, ensure the quast.py script is accessible.
Execute Pipeline:
>**bash (your_pipeline_name).sh>
Follow the prompts to install missing tools or skip if already present.
Provide the accession number of your FASTQ files (e.g., SRR1234567) when prompted.

## Output
The pipeline will generate the following directories:

1. fastqc_result/: FastQC reports for raw and trimmed reads.
2. trimmomatic/: Trimmed FASTQ files.
3. assembly_output/: Unicycler assembly results (including assembly.fasta).
4. annotated_genome/: Prokka annotation output files (GBK, FAA, etc.).
5. quast_evaluation_result/: QUAST evaluation reports (if QUAST is run).
6. NCBI_submission_materials/: Key files prepared for NCBI submission.

## Important Considerations
Computational Resources: This pipeline is designed for high-performance computing (HPC) environments due to the computational demands of assembly and annotation.
Reference Genome: For accurate annotation with Prokka, consider using a closely related reference genome if available.
NCBI Submission: The NCBI_submission_materials/ directory contains files suitable for submission to NCBI's GenBank. Be sure to review and adjust metadata as needed before submission.
